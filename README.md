# Russian_Roulette
A simple script that allows you to select a number between 1 and 6, if you guess (in)correctly, your computer has its essential files wiped

This is a script that shouldn't be used unless you're fully prepared to lose everything on the machine you're running this script on.

All responsibility is with the individual running the script, this script can and will try to destroy your computer.

To make the script run as intended, uncomment the lines marked with !!! DO NOT UNCOMMENT THIS -->, and optionally remove the two print statements preceeding them.

The script requrires to be run with administrator privileges, simply do this and pass in the number between 1 and 6 you want to use

Example: python russian_roulette.py 3
